# Hosted workflow: development and release operations

Status: implementation branch, not an activated hosted service. The public production application remains a recorded demo. Current code forces production demo mode even if `SHIPTESTED_PUBLIC_DEMO=0`; changing that guard is a separate release step, after the acceptance gates in HOSTED-WORKFLOW.md pass.

## Development setup

1. Use Node 22, `npm ci` and `npm run build:packages`.
2. Configure a dedicated development Neon database privately in `.env.local`. Confirm its project and branch in Neon before running `npm run db:migrate`; never infer development isolation from the filename. The migration command applies all numbered plain SQL migrations in one transaction. Take a provider backup/branch before a production migration.
3. Configure GitHub OAuth with this development origin and `/api/auth/github/callback`. Keep a small numeric user allowlist in `SHIPTESTED_GITHUB_MEMBER_IDS`; use two distinct test identities. Keep open registration off until abuse handling and customer onboarding are reviewed.
4. For private repositories, install the configured GitHub App only on selected repositories and configure the administrator-owned actor-to-installation mapping. Customer onboarding is implemented behind `SHIPTESTED_CUSTOMER_REPOSITORIES=1` but has not passed live provider acceptance. See the configuration section below; keep this disabled until then. Identity OAuth alone does not authorize private repository reads.
5. Start the app with `npm run dev`. A second terminal can run `node --env-file=.env.local --import tsx scripts/repository-worker.ts` to process one queued job. Jobs are durable, lease-fenced and limited to three attempts. Scans read bounded manifests; they do not execute repository code.
6. Test the complete account → repository → queued job → persisted report journey. Sign out and sign back in to confirm the report URL persists. A second account must get a denial for that private report. Test explicit share creation, expiry, revocation, disabled owner and seat loss separately.

## Trusted scheduling

`GET /api/internal/worker` handles scan work; `GET /api/internal/billing-worker` handles billing reconciliation. Both require `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>` with a privately generated secret of at least 32 characters. Do not put this secret in URLs or browser code. No recurring schedule is currently configured.

Configure schedules only on the intended hosted service after identifying its database and verifying public-demo mode is off there. HTTP handlers record worker execution outcomes in `sc_worker_runs`. Each invocation processes at most one job; capacity and backlog monitoring must be measured before offering throughput guarantees. Inspect queued age and repeated worker failures, not just HTTP health. Provider/hosting spend is not yet metered.

## Stripe test configuration

Peter selected HeySalad US, with Team priced at GBP 3 per seat monthly. This is a billing-account decision, not evidence that the connected account has been verified. Stripe reconnection and provider-side test configuration remain outstanding.

Use a test API key with only the permissions required by checkout, customer, subscription, Price and portal operations. Configure an active GBP 300 licensed monthly Price, customer portal and signature-verified webhook endpoint `/api/billing/webhook`. Keep `SHIPTESTED_BILLING_LIVE=0`. Verify currency/account configuration rather than substituting USD. The provisional allowance is five scans per seat per month; overages, AI research and sandbox execution are excluded.

Run a real test checkout, verify the paid invoice and reconciled allowance, then test duplicate events, renewal, failed payment, quantity reduction, cancellation and portal access. The checkout return page never grants seats. Paid capacity comes only from server reconciliation. Live activation, taxes and customer-facing terms need an explicit release review; no real charges are enabled by these instructions.

## CLI, SDK and local MCP

The implementation branch adds the `@heysalad/shiptested/hosted` export and CLI `repo`, `job`, `report`, `usage` commands. These additions have not been published to npm. Build from this checkout for testing; do not assume the existing public 0.1.0 packages contain them.

Create an agent token in `/team`, select read-only or scan permission, and save it privately as `SHIPTESTED_API_TOKEN`. Configure `SHIPTESTED_API_ORIGIN` to the fixed service origin. Tokens expire after 30 days and are revocable. They cannot manage billing, teammates or other tokens. Scan permission consumes the same workspace allowance as the website.

Local MCP uses the same environment variables to enable its managed tools; the anonymous public MCP never receives account tokens. `scan_repository` requires a UUID request key, reused when retrying the same operation. A successful queue response is not a security verdict. Poll the job and inspect the final report's completeness and coverage.

## Release and recovery

Keep schema, package and app versions aligned. Build, typecheck and test before a reviewable PR. Verify a protected hosted deployment with actual authentication and a dedicated database before changing public production. Preserve old reports and audit history during rollback; rolling back code is not permission to drop tables or reset allowances. Revoke a compromised agent token immediately, disable the affected account if necessary, and retain token-free audit evidence.


## Customer GitHub App repository authorization (not activated)

This is distinct from identity-only OAuth. Configure the existing GitHub App's **client ID and client secret** as `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET`, its exact slug as `GITHUB_APP_SLUG`, and its app ID/private key through the existing app settings. Register the exact callback `<origin>/api/github/connect/callback` with no wildcard. Store an independent 32-byte random AES key as 64 lowercase hex characters in `SHIPTESTED_CONNECTION_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; do not use an OAuth secret as an encryption key.

Apply migration 008 to the intended database. Only after live acceptance, enable `SHIPTESTED_CUSTOMER_REPOSITORIES=1`. While enabled, repository token issuance uses customer-authorized grants rather than the legacy administrator mapping. The website's identity login remains separate. Tokens for this connection are encrypted with AES-GCM and bound to account/workspace, expire locally after at most one hour and require explicit renewal; refresh tokens are not stored. Disconnect deletes the locally stored token. Removing provider-side authorization or the installation remains a GitHub action. This is not unattended long-term repository authorization yet.

In `/team`, first choose repositories in the configured GitHub App installation, then authorize repository access using the same GitHub account as sign-in. Select an installation from the server-verified list. Before minting each repository token, the server lists that user's installations and repository access again, then restricts the installation token to their intersection. Read-only repository users cannot obtain a write token. Installations and user-visible repositories are bounded; unsupported totals fail explicitly.

Live acceptance still required: an actual owner and a read-only collaborator, an organization installation, revoked organization membership, removal of one repository, expired authorization, reconnect/disconnect and repair write denial. Unit tests and fixture browser journeys do not prove GitHub's deployed callback or permission configuration.

## Bounded persistent worker acceptance

`scripts/hosted-worker.ts` can run on a trusted persistent host instead of manually invoking HTTP handlers. Supply credentials via the host's secret store, explicitly set `SHIPTESTED_PUBLIC_DEMO=0`, and pin `SHIPTESTED_WORKER_DB_HOST` to the intended database hostname. Set `SHIPTESTED_WORKER_STOP_AT` to an ISO timestamp within the next 24 hours. This bounded runner is suitable for preview acceptance; it deliberately does not create an unattended indefinite service against the disposable database.

Run `node --env-file=.env.hosted-acceptance --import tsx scripts/hosted-worker.ts` with those variables supplied. It processes one scan per cycle, waits 15 seconds after work, and records worker outcomes. Optional `SHIPTESTED_WORKER_BILLING=1` enables billing reconciliation only after billing configuration validates. Scan failures do not suppress billing work. SIGTERM/SIGINT finish the active operation and prevent the next cycle; allow at least the longest worker operation as the supervisor's shutdown grace. Errors are sanitized. Retries of jobs remain governed by database leases, not the supervisor.

An always-on cloud worker/scheduler is still an activation gate: select its runtime, deploy secrets privately, bind it to the non-disposable hosted database, verify backlog/recovery and monitor costs before customer release. This script is not evidence that a recurring cloud schedule is running.
